description: Environment checks and developer utilities for the starter kit
---

The Tools page provides quick environment checks and safe utilities to help developers validate setup during local development. It is intended for starter kit onboarding and is not a production observability dashboard.

## Access

- URL: `/tools`
- Role: Admin only

## What It Checks

- Convex connection and deployment ID
- WorkOS client ID, API key, and webhook secret
- Lemon Squeezy configuration (optional)

## Billing Configuration Warning

If Lemon Squeezy is configured but plan mapping is missing, the Tools page shows a warning. This usually means the Convex environment is missing `LEMONSQUEEZY_PRO_VARIANT_ID` or `LEMONSQUEEZY_BUSINESS_VARIANT_ID`. When those are absent, paid subscriptions will default to free tier limits.

:::tip
For starter kit projects, it is fine to leave billing unconfigured. The app will run on the free tier by default.

## Webhook Simulator

The Tools page includes a simple WorkOS webhook simulator for `invitation.accepted`. It is useful for confirming the invite flow without waiting on real emails.

## Related Setup

- `SETUP.md` for local environment variables
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` for production webhook configuration
